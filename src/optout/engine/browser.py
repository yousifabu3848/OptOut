"""Persistent-context Chrome launcher.

Launches real installed Chrome with a persistent user-data directory at
~/.config/optout/browser_profile/. Cloudflare and other bot-detection
systems set cookies after the first human-solved challenge; those cookies
persist across runs so the user only has to solve the challenge once per
broker, not every time.

Using launch_persistent_context (not launch + new_context) is deliberate:
it is the only Playwright API that retains cookies, localStorage, and the
full browser fingerprint between sessions.
