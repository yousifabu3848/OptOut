# Contributing to OptOut

The fastest way to contribute is to add a broker — it requires only a YAML file, no Python.

---

## Adding a broker

### 1. Verify the opt-out process manually first

Before writing any YAML, go through the broker's opt-out flow yourself in a browser. Note:

- Is the opt-out a web form or an email address?
- If a web form: what fields does it have? What selectors?
- Does it require finding your listing URL first?
- Does it send a verification email or SMS?
- Does it show a CAPTCHA?
- What does the confirmation screen look like?

Do not guess at selectors. Inspect the live page.

### 2. Copy the template

```bash
cp src/optout/data/brokers/whitepages.yml src/optout/data/brokers/your-broker.yml   # web-form with listing search
# or
cp src/optout/data/brokers/spokeo.yml src/optout/data/brokers/your-broker.yml       # simple web form
```

### 3. Fill in the top-level fields

```yaml
slug: your-broker           # MUST match the filename (your-broker.yml)
name: Your Broker           # human-readable name shown in the CLI
domain: yourbroker.com
category: people_search     # people_search | marketing | background_check | other
parent_company: null        # or "Acme Data Corp" if applicable
method: web_form            # web_form | email | postal | manual

# Exactly one of these:
opt_out_url: "https://yourbroker.com/optout"
opt_out_email: null
opt_out_postal_address: null
```

### 4. Set the requirements flags

```yaml
required_fields: [full_name, current_address, email_current]
optional_fields: [dob, aliases, previous_addresses]

requires_listing_url: true      # true if user must find their listing URL first
requires_phone_verification: false
requires_email_verification: true
requires_id_upload: false
requires_notarization: false
```

These flags drive the CLI's pre-flight checklist. Set them exactly — if the broker requires phone verification, `requires_phone_verification` must be `true` and the steps must include an `sms_verification_prompt` step.

### 5. Set the legal metadata

```yaml
legal_basis: [CCPA, CPRA]  # from: CCPA, CPRA, GDPR, VCDPA, CPA, CTDPA, UCPA
statutory_response_days: 45
re_add_window_days: 60     # how soon data typically reappears; null if unknown

last_verified_at: 2026-04-20   # today's date — update when you re-verify
notes: |
  Free-form notes about quirks, caveats, and anything a future contributor
  should know. Mention if selectors are fragile, if the broker frequently
  rejects or ignores requests, etc.
```

### 6. Add the scan block

The scan block lets `optout scan` check whether your data appears on this broker:

```yaml
scan:
  search_url_template: "https://yourbroker.com/search?q={name_slug}&state={state}"
  result_selector: ".person-card, .search-result"
  match_fields: [full_name, current_address]
```

Template variables available in `search_url_template`:
- `{name_slug}` — URL-encoded full name (e.g. `Jane-Public`)
- `{state}` — two-letter address state code (e.g. `TX`)

### 7. Write the steps (web_form brokers only)

Steps are executed in order by the Playwright interpreter in `engine/methods/web_form.py`. Email-method brokers leave `steps: []`.

#### Step types

**`navigate`** — load a URL

```yaml
- id: open_optout_form
  type: navigate
  url: "https://yourbroker.com/optout"
```

**`search`** — search for the user's listing and prompt them to pick one

```yaml
- id: find_listing
  type: search
  search_url_template: "https://yourbroker.com/search?q={name_slug}&state={state}"
  result_selector: ".person-card"
  pick_strategy: prompt_user     # always prompt_user — never auto-pick
```

Required when `requires_listing_url: true`. The selected URL is stored as `{state.found_listing_url}` for use in later steps.

**`form_fill`** — fill one or more fields

```yaml
- id: fill_form
  type: form_fill
  fields:
    listing_url:
      selector: "input[name='url'], input[placeholder*='yourbroker.com']"
      value: "{state.found_listing_url}"
    email:
      selector: "input[name='email'], input[type='email']"
      value: "{profile.emails.current[0]}"
```

Field name (e.g. `listing_url`, `email`) is a label for logging only. The `selector` is a CSS selector. Use comma-separated alternatives for resilience.

**`prompt_user_if_present`** — pause and prompt the user when a selector is visible

```yaml
- id: handle_captcha
  type: prompt_user_if_present
  selector: ".g-recaptcha, iframe[src*='recaptcha'], .recaptcha-checkbox"
  message: "Please solve the CAPTCHA in the browser window, then press Enter."
```

Use this for: CAPTCHAs, listing-selection UI, email-verification instructions. The step is a no-op if the selector is not found on the current page.

**`click`** — click a button or element

```yaml
- id: submit
  type: click
  selector: "button[type='submit'], button.optout-submit"
```

**`sms_verification_prompt`** — enter an SMS code

```yaml
- id: phone_verify
  type: sms_verification_prompt
  code_selector: "input[name='code'], input[type='tel']"
  message: "Enter the SMS code YourBroker sent to the phone number on the listing:"
```

Required when `requires_phone_verification: true`.

**`capture`** — take a confirmation screenshot (always the last step)

```yaml
- id: capture_confirmation
  type: capture
  method: screenshot
  save_as: "{submission.id}-your-broker-confirmation.png"
```

#### Template variables in step values

| Variable | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `{name_slug}` | URL-encoded full name |
| `{state}` | Two-letter address state code OR step state object (context-dependent) |
| `{state.found_listing_url}` | URL picked during a `search` step |
| `{profile.legal_name}` | User's full legal name |
| `{profile.emails.current[0]}` | User's primary email address |
| `{profile.phones.current[0]}` | User's primary phone number |
| `{profile.current_address.city}` | City from the user's current address |
| `{submission.id}` | UUID of the current submission record |
| `{broker.slug}` | The broker's slug |

### 8. Validate before opening a PR

```bash
# Install dev dependencies (requires uv)
uv sync --extra dev

# Validate your new file against the schema
uv run python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from optout.brokers.loader import load_broker
b = load_broker(Path('src/optout/data/brokers/your-broker.yml'))
print(f'OK: {b.slug} ({b.method})')
"

# Run the full broker test suite
uv run pytest tests/test_production_brokers.py -v

# Check that all selectors are reachable on the live page
uv run optout verify --broker your-broker --headed
```

The CI pipeline runs `validate-brokers` on every push and PR, so any schema error will be caught there too.

### 9. Verification checklist

Before committing a new or updated broker YAML, confirm:

- [ ] `slug` exactly matches the filename stem (`your-broker.yml` → `slug: your-broker`)
- [ ] `method` is consistent with `opt_out_url` / `opt_out_email`
- [ ] `requires_listing_url: true` ↔ there is a `search` step
- [ ] `requires_phone_verification: true` ↔ there is an `sms_verification_prompt` step
- [ ] All step `id` values are unique within the broker
- [ ] Web-form brokers end with a `capture` step
- [ ] `last_verified_at` is set to today's date
- [ ] You personally ran through the opt-out flow in a browser and confirmed the selectors match the live page
- [ ] Notes explain any known quirks (fragile selectors, re-add behavior, response time)
- [ ] `uv run pytest tests/test_production_brokers.py` passes locally

## Updating an existing broker

When a broker changes their opt-out flow:

1. Go through the new flow manually.
2. Update the affected `steps` and any flags.
3. Update `last_verified_at` to today.
4. Add a note in the `notes` block describing what changed and when.
5. Run the verification checklist above.

## Code contributions

For anything beyond broker YAMLs, open an issue first to discuss the approach. The project has a deliberate scope:

- No SaaS, no multi-tenancy, no accounts.
- No programmatic CAPTCHA solving.
- No submission on behalf of users other than the operator.
- No bot-detection evasion (stealth plugins, proxy rotation, fingerprint spoofing).

These are not gaps to fill — they are the project's legal foundation.

### Dev setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blake104/OptOut.git
cd OptOut
uv sync --extra dev
uv run playwright install chromium
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/optout/
```

### Running CI checks locally

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/            # lint
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/   # format
uv run mypy src/optout/                  # types
uv run pytest                            # tests
```

## Conduct

Be straightforward. The project exists to help people remove their personal data from commercial databases. Keep contributions focused on that.
